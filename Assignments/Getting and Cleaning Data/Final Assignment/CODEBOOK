Below is a brief description of the variables in the tidy dataset:
subject - the ID of the subject who performed the activity.

activity - a numeric code representing the activity type.
activity_name - a descriptive name of the activity (e.g., WALKING, SITTING, STANDING, etc.).
tBodyAcc-mean()-X - the average of the body acceleration signal in the X direction (time domain).
tBodyAcc-mean()-Y - the average of the body acceleration signal in the Y direction.
tBodyAcc-mean()-Z - the average of the body acceleration signal in the Z direction.
tBodyAcc-std()-X - the average standard deviation of the body acceleration signal in the X direction.
tBodyAcc-std()-Y - the average standard deviation of the body acceleration signal in the Y direction.
tBodyAcc-std()-Z - the average standard deviation of the body acceleration signal in the Z direction.

Additional variables in the tidy dataset follow similar naming conventions. For a complete description of all 
variables, please refer to the features.txt file that comes with the UCI HAR Dataset.
